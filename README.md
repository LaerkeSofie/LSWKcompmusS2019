## David Bowie

David Bowie has been a music icon for more than half a century with as many as 43 albums (including expanded and live versions) on Spotify. How has his musical style changed over time when looking at different Spotify audio features? How does this compare to the popularity of the albums and songs and how can the changes and differences be explained? 

To identify Bowie's style I will first select all of the original (with some remastered) albums available on Spotify to constitute my corpus. This adds up to 26 different albums spanning from the year 1967 to 2016. The large size of this corpus allows for wide research of Bowie's development of sound expression.

My first research deals with the Spotify features danceability, acousticness, and valence since these features might give me some different results regarding the evolution of Bowie's musical style. My initial idea is to make several graphs viewing each decade to look for outliers. These outliers will thereafter be subject for further research.

The following plot show valence on the x-axis, danceability on the y-axis, and the colours show the different album release dates. This plot is not ideal since it is overloaded with information. My plan is therefore to find a way in which I can filter albums from each decade to make a more clear and well-arranged plot.

My research question is about Bowie's development of musical style and popularity over time. Therefore it might be interesting to look at the difference in the Spotify features track popularity, to see if there are any outliers. I find a big difference in the average track popularity and one song with a popularity of 75. That song is “Starman” which might be interesting to include further research of in future weeks.
