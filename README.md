## David Bowie

David Bowie has been a music icon for more than half a century with as many as 43 albums (including expanded and live versions) on Spotify. How has his musical style changed over time, keeping the popularity of the albums and songs in mind?

To identify Bowie's style I will first select tree albums from the discography based on album popularity. I found that the minimum album popularity was 27, the median album popularity 44, and the maximum album popularity of Bowie's albums 75 according to the Spotify measure scale from 0 - 100. The album with the lowest popularity turns out to be both his first album “David Bowie”(1967) and the album “'hours..’ (Expanded Version)” (1999). The album with median popularity is the live album “Cracked Actor (Live Los Angeles ’74)” (2017) and the album with maximum popularity is “The Rise and Fall Of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (2012 Remastered Version)” (1972).

For my corpus, I have decided to select the album “'hours..’ (Expanded Version)” (1999) to serve as my album with the lowest popularity. The corpus now represents an overview of Bowie's popularity through time. Given that the albums have varying release years I give me the possibility of adding the time of release as a comparing factor. 

My research question is about Bowie's style and popularity over time. Therefore it might be interesting to look at the difference in the Spotify features track popularity, to see if there are any outliers. I find that there were no outliers on the albums with lowest and median popularity, but on the album with the highest popularity I find a big difference in the average track popularity and one song with a popularity of 75. That song is “Starman” which might be interesting to include further research of in future weeks.
